# 🎤 Audio Deepfake Detection using RawNet2 (ASVspoof 2019)

A deep learning-based solution for detecting audio deepfakes using the **RawNet2** architecture. Trained on the **ASVspoof 2019 Logical Access (LA)** dataset, this project classifies audio clips as either genuine (bonafide) or fake (spoofed).

## 🔎 1. Why Audio Deepfake Detection?

With the rapid evolution of AI voice synthesis (like deepfake voice cloning), detecting audio-based spoofing has become critical for protecting biometric authentication systems, online meetings, and voice-activated devices from malicious attacks.

## 🎯 2. Why RawNet2?

We explored three models for this project:

1. **RawNet2**
2. **LCNN (Light CNN)**
3. **X-vector + Cosine Scoring**

After evaluating architecture complexity, performance, and adaptability to raw waveform inputs, we selected **RawNet2** as the final model.

| Model                 | Input Type       | Architecture Type         | Feature Extraction | Accuracy (on LA) | Complexity | Real-Time Capability | Notes                                                                 |
|----------------------|------------------|----------------------------|---------------------|------------------|------------|-----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **RawNet2**           | Raw Waveform     | CNN + GRU (End-to-End)     | ✅ Learned features | **85–90%**        | Moderate   | ✅ Yes                 | Best performance, real-time ready, no manual preprocessing required   |
| **LCNN (Light CNN)**  | Spectrogram (FFT)| CNN + Max-Feature-Map      | ❌ Manual features  | ~82–85%           | High       | ❌ No                  | Heavy preprocessing and slower inference                              |
| **X-vector + Cosine**| MFCC             | DNN + Cosine Similarity    | ❌ Manual features  | ~78–80%           | Low        | ✅ Yes                 | Simple but less accurate, mainly designed for speaker verification    |

### ✅ 2.2 Why RawNet2 Wins

- **End-to-End Learning**: Processes raw waveform input directly, removing the need for manual feature extraction.
- **Performance**: Outperforms other models in terms of accuracy and adaptability to deepfake variations.
- **Efficiency**: Lightweight and real-time capable, suitable for real-world deployment.
- **Designed for Anti-Spoofing**: RawNet2 was proposed for voice spoof detection challenges and is optimized for such tasks.
